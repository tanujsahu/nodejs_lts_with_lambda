## Overview

This project sets up an Express.js application running on AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework. The application includes basic CRUD APIs and is structured with separate routes and controllers.

**Features:**
- CRUD operations for items
- Organized codebase with routes and controllers
- Local development using `serverless-offline`
- Deployment to AWS Lambda

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Serverless Framework
- AWS CLI (configured with your credentials)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/serverless-express-project.git
   cd serverless-express-project


## Install Dependencies

        npm install
        Install Serverless Framework (if not installed globally)
        npm install -g serverless

## Running Locally
## For local development, use the serverless-offline plugin to emulate AWS Lambda and API Gateway locally.

# Start the Local Server

        npm start
        This will start the server at http://localhost:3000/dev/.

        Access the API Endpoints

        Use tools like curl, Postman, or your web browser to interact with the API.

## GET /api/items: Retrieve a list of items.
## POST /api/items: Create a new item.
## GET /api/items/
        : Retrieve a specific item by ID.

## PUT /api/items/
        : Update an item by ID.

## DELETE /api/items/
        : Delete an item by ID.

## Deploying to AWS
        To deploy the application to AWS Lambda and API Gateway:

## Deploy the Service

        npm run deploy
        This command will package your application and deploy it to AWS Lambda. You will receive a URL for the API Gateway endpoint in the output.

## Test the Deployed API

        Use the provided API Gateway URL to test the deployed endpoints, replacing /dev/ with the stage name if necessary.

# API Endpoints
